# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Dev Notes

- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) I love this library and using utility classes over creating classes and stylesheets. Makes styling very fast and fund.
- **GraphQL**: [graphql-hooks](https://github.com/nearform/graphql-hooks) Simple GraphQL client using hooks. I didn't feel the need to include something like Apollo for a simple project.

### How to run app & test

> Copy `env.template` and rename it `.env.local` then add your Github API key to the value `REACT_APP_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics

- Code Structuring: wouldn't change anything unless the scope of the project grew

- Refactoring: none

- Additional Features: It might be nice to include some info about each topic like a description of each library. Also, a link to the Github repo
